Rather than editing these templates, copy them into a new directory and edit the copies.
Then when you run ExtensionBoilerplate, include these arguments: --templates path/to/copied/templates/

Three macros are provided to the templates. These are the `regexMatch()`, `regexReplace()`, and `includeIf()` functions. These three macros are also provided, along with examples, in [this template testing utility](https://github.com/player-03/Haxe-Template-UI).
